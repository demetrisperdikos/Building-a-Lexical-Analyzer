In this programming assignment, you will be building a lexical analyzer for small programming language and a program to test it. This assignment will be followed by two other assignments to build a parser and interpreter to the same language. Although, we are not concerned about the syntax definitions of the language in this assignment, we intend to introduce it ahead of Programming Assignment 2 in order to show the language reserved words, constants, and operators. The syntax definitions of the small programming language, called Pascal-Like Simple Language (PLSL), are given below using EBNF notations. The PLSL syntax has some features similar to the well-known Pascal Language. However, the details of the meanings (i.e. semantics) of the language constructs will be given later on.

See the programming assignment statement for details about the PLSL syntactic rules, the definitions of the language lexical categories, and the assignment requirements.
